THIS THE SMALL PROGRAM USING RECURSIONS IN PYTHON PROGRAMING
The Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical problem which consists of three rods and multiple disks. Initially, all the disks are placed on one rod, one over the other in ascending order of size similar to a cone-shaped tower.

The objective of this problem is to move the stack of disks from the initial rod to another rod, following these rules:

A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
No disk can be placed on top of the smaller disk.
The goal is to move all the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod. To move N disks from one rod to another, 2^ùëÅ‚àí1 steps are required. So, to move 3 disks from starting the rod to the ending rod, a total of 7 steps are required.
